# The Field Survey

## Overview

The first thing we need to do on our path toward understanding our professional future is a set of surveys: one that will help you understand 
your personal goals for this class and another that you can use to start thinking about exploring the various directions that this course can take 
for you. The main questions we're interested in are those of what one field that catches your interest _looks like_.

Given that there are a wide variety of "end game" scenarios for everyone doing professional development work, this assignment features a few paths.
It's, however, that for now you stick with one and complete this work using one area on which to focus your attention.

## Deliverables

### The Goals Survey

To better plan how we complete activities, our experience with these materials has shown that it's helpful to know what each
participant intends to get from the content. To that end, please fill out:

### The Industry Survey

Complete this in the [`writing/report.md`](writing/report.md) file.

#### Professional Edition

Prepare a brief report on an industry of your choice. Mostly, this should sketch the contours of what kinds of opportunities
are available and where conversations in the field happen. A basic response covers:

* Professional organizations or trade groups that you'd consider joining or at least keeping up with
* Certifications or other professional credentials you think might help you during your professional life (it can be a list)
* Conventions, trade group meetings, or major discipline specific events that you think you might like to attend (virtually, even!)
* Other things you're doing/have done/will do to be a part of a larger community in the area you're focusing on
* Publications or newsletters that you see as important to subscribe to or read
* Major media sites where professionals in the field discuss issues (this can be same or different than a publication, but usually is different)
* What issues are currently "hot topics" in the industry
* Where folks in the field go to find jobs (i.e. the most active job boards)

#### Academic Edition

For folks looking at graduate schools or other academic opportunities:

* Find `5` schools that interest you, but don't do this by looking at rankings; really _look_ and see what kinds of research is happening at a given location
  * Examine the admissions requirements for these programs -- what do you need to have/do in order to apply?
  * Do they offer fellowships or paid teaching positions?
  * There are many more considerations to list than could fit; find the unique areas of each program; also identify patterns
* Specify `2` faculty members that work in a field you're interested in or are already working; list some of their publications
* Find at least `5` academic journals that appear to be active and significant in the field; list them and give a brief description of the kinds of work they publish
  * What does it take to publish a paper in one of them?
* Find research topics which are currently dominant in the field; list at least `3`
* Discover conventions and other disciplnary gatherings particular to the field; depending on your chosen focus, these may be pretty small
* A list or description of typical outcomes of a graduate-level education based on the programs you've chosen
