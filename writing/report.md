# Industry Survey report

Choose one of the below (and erase all of this boilerplate instructional text.)

## Professional Edition

Prepare a brief report on an industry of your choice. Mostly, this should sketch the contours of what kinds of opportunities
are available and where conversations in the field happen. A basic response covers:

* Professional organizations or trade groups that you'd consider joining or at least keeping up with
* Certifications or other professional credentials you think might help you during your professional life (it can be a list)
* Conventions, trade group meetings, or major discipline specific events that you think you might like to attend (virtually, even!)
* Other things you're doing/have done/will do to be a part of a larger community in the area you're focusing on
* Publications or newsletters that you see as important to subscribe to or read
* Major media sites where professionals in the field discuss issues (this can be same or different than a publication, but usually is different)
* What issues are currently "hot topics" in the industry

## Academic Edition

For folks looking at graduate schools or other academic opportunities:

* Find `5` schools that interest you, but don't do this by looking at rankings; really _look_ and see what kinds of research is happening at a given location
  * Examine the admissions requirements for these programs -- what do you need to have/do in order to apply?
* Specify `2` faculty members that work in a field you're interested in or are already working; list some of their publications
* Find at least `5` academic journals that appear to be active and significant in the field; list them and give a brief description of the kinds of work they publish
  * What does it take to publish a paper in one of them?
* Find research topics which are currently dominant in the field; list at least `3`
* Discover conventions and other disciplnary gatherings particular to the field; depending on your chosen focus, these may be pretty small
